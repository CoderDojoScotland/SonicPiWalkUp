Sonic Pi Walk Up Workshop
=========================

Materials for a 10 minute walk-up workshop on Sonic-Pi.  This can be extended by allowing the participants to continue experimenting with the program after they've worked through the examples in Demo Files.

The folder DemoFiles contains a copy of Daft Punk's "Get Lucky" coded in Sonic Pi (from http://www.sonicpiliveandcoding.com/), plus files numbered 0 through 9 which build up an example containing three live loops.

SonicPiScript.pdf contains detailed instructions for how to work through the files in DemoFiles

sonicPiCribsheetlonger.pdf covers some commonly used commands

example-simple.txt is another simple example containing three live loops

example-fancier.txt is the simple example with a few more samples added, plus live loop commented out containing a sample not included in the Sonic Pi distribution (this can be replaced with a sample on your own machine).
